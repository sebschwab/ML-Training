# Computing Correlation Using AI

Sebastian Schwab

> In this project, I use Python to interpret and analyze the "yalefaces.mat" file which includes over 2000 images of faces from different lightings.
> This data set was created in the early days of AI, and was one of the first facial recognition algorithms created.

## Sec. I. Introduction and Overview
Throughout this project I use a matrix to represent all of the photos together, this matrix X uses a compressed form of manipulation that turns every 2D image into a single column. Therefore, every column represents a single image. I also create correlational matrices, to perform this you must dot product one matrix to the transpose of itself ($C = A*A^T$). 

An eigenvector is a vector that when multiplied by a matrix A, produces a scalar multiple of A. 

Such as: $A * V = A*A^T$ where V is the eigenvector.
