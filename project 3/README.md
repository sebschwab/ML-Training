# Computing Correlation Using AI

Sebastian Schwab

> In this project, I use Python to interpret and analyze the MNIST dataset, which includes 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits 0-9. Each image is also
labeled with its correct digit. I use several different training machine and learning algorithms to compare their effectiveness at identifying and classifying these handwritten digits.

## Sec. I. Introduction and Overview

The MNIST data set was created in 1998 and consists of over 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits 0-9. The purpose of this dataset is to train and then subsequently test different learning algorithms and compare their effectiveness. While it is easy for a human to identify any written number, describing to a computer is difficult. So, algorithms such as the Singular Value Decomposition, Linear Classifier (LDA), Support Vector Machine, and decision tree are used to group the data together by similarities and try to create an accurate label.

#### Singular Value Decomposition

One way to factorize data is known as the Singular Value Decomposition and is given by:

A visual representation of this is:
