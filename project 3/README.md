# Computing Correlation Using AI

Sebastian Schwab

> In this project, I use Python to interpret and analyze the MNIST dataset, which includes 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits 0-9. Each image is also
labeled with its correct digit. I use several different training machine and learning algorithms to compare their effectiveness at identifying and classifying these handwritten digits.

## Sec. I. Introduction and Overview

The MNIST data set was created in 1998 and consists of over 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits 0-9. The purpose of this dataset is to train and then subsequently test different learning algorithms and compare their effectiveness. While it is easy for a human to identify any written number, describing to a computer is difficult. So, algorithms such as the ...
